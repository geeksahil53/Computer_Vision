*Real-Time Hand Tracking using MediaPipe and OpenCV*
This project demonstrates real-time hand tracking using MediaPipe and OpenCV. It captures video from your webcam and identifies 21 hand landmarks, drawing the connections on the screen in real time.

*Requirements*
Python 3.6 or higher

OpenCV

MediaPipe

Install the required dependencies using:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install opencv-python mediapipe
How to Run
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hand-tracking.git
cd hand-tracking
Run the script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python hand_tracking.py
Press q to exit the program.

How It Works
Captures live video feed using OpenCV.

Converts each frame to RGB and processes it using MediaPipe’s Hands solution.

Draws 21 hand landmarks and their connections using MediaPipe’s drawing_utils.

Continuously updates the display in a loop until manually exited.

Features
Real-time hand detection and tracking

21-point hand landmark identification

Lightweight and efficient

Easy to set up and extend

Potential Improvements
Add gesture recognition (e.g., thumbs up, peace sign)

Integrate with a virtual mouse or gesture-based control system

Store hand movement data for model training or analysis
